## Projects

### Cosmics

A simple 3D particle animator

I have been coding step-by-step simulators and particle clouds since the 90, in languages and for environments that aren't in use anymore. All my first attempts where 2D, though.

It's just an excuse to train with _three.js_, again.

### Hello Science

A bunch of tiny programs written **in many different languages** that either help **solving math problems** about **puzzles**, **enigmas**, **physics**, **biology**, **games**, etc... or to display view of beautiful math objects.

Of course one should use _Wolfram Mathematica_ and _Geogebra_ for this kind of work, but this is all about training myself at writing code in many languages and learn more science by practice. There is nothing like diving right into the complexity of implementation rather than in the documentation of unknown libraries.

#### Game Solving

- Sudoku and variants
- picross...triangular or 3D variants for picross...
- Hanoï tower game and variants

#### Math displays

- Syracuse algorithm
- Complex polynomial fractal sets: Newton, Mandelbrot, Julia&Fatou fractals

### Instant Page Messer

The most convenient way to turn any web page into complete chaos

Instant Page messer is a silly **Chromium extension** that you can install in Chrome, Brave or the like, that let you **mess with the page you see** in random and unexpected manners just by clicking on a button.

This is an excuse to have fun, train even more with JavaScript, the DOM and CSS, and code my first extension for Chrome.

### Nessieur

A simple 3D chaotic curve animator

This is the 3D resurrections of a 2D project from the early 2000 inspired by a page of the great book _Visions Géométriques_ écrit par *Ian Stewart*. It's also an simple exercice I decided to carry out in order to learn _tree.js_ and update my knowledge in the field of **geometric algebra**.

### Splatcheur

A not so simple painting-with-a-pendular-articulated-arm simulator, with graphic export.
